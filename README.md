This project aims to replicate the core functionalities of Jira, a popular project management tool. It allows users to:

* Create and manage projects.
* Create and track tasks (issues).
* Organize tasks into different statuses (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
* Potentially, depending on the videos, assign tasks to users.
* Possibly, depending on the videos, have drag and drop functionality.

This project is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating how to build a web application with project management features.
